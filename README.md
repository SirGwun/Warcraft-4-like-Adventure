# Project "Warcraft-4-like Adventure"

This project is my pet project where I am creating a real-time browser-based strategy game similar to Warcraft. I am developing this game for practice, learning, and to include in my portfolio.

## About the Project

### Key Features

- **Game Engine**: Developing a custom game engine to manage the real-time game world.

- **Player Interface**: Designing a user-friendly interface for managing the base, resources, and armies.
